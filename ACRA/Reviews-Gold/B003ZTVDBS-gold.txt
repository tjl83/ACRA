Then I came back to Q-Tips, and truly wonder why we ever tried the others. Q-Tips have just the right amount of bend-but-don't-break to 'em, they have a proper amount of cotton, and they are definitely built to do their job. I work in cosmetics and our store just never seems to have enough supplies, so 1,000 or so are heading to work with me tomorrow (and my ladies at the counter will be sooo happy!). A couple of the packs will also be heading to our daughter in college... she came home for Fall Break intending to 'steal' a few, but we were out. Now we're not, and we promised to send them in a care package; think she expects 1,350? Ha! While most get used for typical make-up and hygiene needs, Q-Tips are outstanding for other things too. For example, our son races remote control cars and uses Q-Tips when cleaning his motors and transmissions. Additionally, my husband spends a lot of time at the range maintaining his qualifications, and he uses Q-Tips for finishing touches when cleaning the inner workings of firearms. Am very glad to have found them in bulk through Amazon's Add-on program, bringing the price equal to or less than what we paid for the discount ones. Outstanding. Q-Tip cotton swabs have been around a long time and, given their excellence, will continue to be around for a long time to come. Excellent product. Highly recommended."]}]

Then I came back to Q-Tips, and truly wonder why we ever tried the others. Q-Tips have just the right amount of bend-but-don't-break to 'em, they have a proper amount of cotton, and they are definitely built to do their job. I work in cosmetics and our store just never seems to have enough supplies, so 1,000 or so are heading to work with me tomorrow (and my ladies at the counter will be sooo happy!). A couple of the packs will also be heading to our daughter in college... she came home for Fall Break intending to 'steal' a few, but we were out. Now we're not, and we promised to send them in a care package; think she expects 1,350? Ha! While most get used for typical make-up and hygiene needs, Q-Tips are outstanding for other things too. For example, our son races remote control cars and uses Q-Tips when cleaning his motors and transmissions. Additionally, my husband spends a lot of time at the range maintaining his qualifications, and he uses Q-Tips for finishing touches when cleaning the inner workings of firearms.

Then I came back to Q-Tips, and truly wonder why we ever tried the others. Q-Tips have just the right amount of bend-but-don't-break to 'em, they have a proper amount of cotton, and they are definitely built to do their job. I work in cosmetics and our store just never seems to have enough supplies, so 1,000 or so are heading to work with me tomorrow (and my ladies at the counter will be sooo happy!). A couple of the packs will also be heading to our daughter in college... she came home for Fall Break intending to 'steal' a few, but we were out. Now we're not, and we promised to send them in a care package; think she expects 1,350? Ha! While most get used for typical make-up and hygiene needs, Q-Tips are outstanding for other things too. For example, our son races remote control cars and uses Q-Tips when cleaning his motors and transmissions. Additionally, my husband spends a lot of time at the range maintaining his qualifications, and he uses Q-Tips for finishing touches when cleaning the inner workings of firearms. Am very glad to have found them in bulk through Amazon's Add-on program, bringing the price equal to or less than what we paid for the discount ones. Outstanding. Q-Tip cotton swabs have been around a long time and, given their excellence, will continue to be around for a long time to come. Excellent product. Highly recommended."]}, {"Username":["drumbum"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like the title says but for the price you cannot beat it. We've tried store brand cotton swabs and nothing compares to Qtips. At this price we won't have to buy them for years. Another great deal from Amazon."]}, {"Username":["K.

They are comfortable and they don't hurt your ears like those cheap brands that have just a stick with hardly any cotton on top. I use the cotton swabs mainly to clean up my eye makeup after applying it - it's just a nice cleaner that can take off the extra makeup or clean up the parts that get close to my eyes, and of course to clean my ears! Best brand of Q-tips and thank goodness that Amazon carries them, because I've practically stopped going to Target altogether. :)!"]}, {"Username":["V.

At the grocery store they are nearly double this price. I usually use about four a day, two in my nose, two in my ears. Individual use may vary. I have heard of all the extremes believe me. Some people use more, some less. You probably don't usually have three giant boxes on hand but if you use them every day like I do you'll go through them soon enough and you'll be glad you had this supply on hand. When Armageddon comes there are four things you'll want: (1) water; (2) batteries; (3) Q-Tips; (4) protein bars; (5) Zorro Mask. I guess there were five things you need. The Zorro mask is for disguising yourself if you need to go steal s**t from other people."]}, {"Username":["Jan Cole"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["There are other brands that pass as \"Q-tips\" but this is the original. The others are not nearly as good. Q-tips have more cotton and are softer. I use them for more than cleaning ears.

The packaging was terrible - so loose that a few of the boxes were already basically open and spilling out when they arrived.
