It works fine, but I was surprised to see that the card itself and the SD reader weren't in a sealed package. These aren't in the retail packaging. They are in a small plastic enclosure with a label over the top specifying the contents inside. What else is odd is that the MicroSD card is made by Kingston, but the SD reader is by SanDisk. What is that all about? The contents are supposedly \"new\" but I have no way of proving that since the packing has been altered. If I knew that ahead of time, I would probably not choose to purchase this item."}

When i got my card i was happy to add power to my phone.. BUT right of the bat.. got a first bad impression... NOT ON SEALED PACKAGE, just plain card plastic case.. which looks kinda cheap too (thin and very easy to open)... i mean i feel it could have been a fake card... or a used one. NEXT i opened the case amd it and looked at the MicroSd card closely and focused on the lil yellow Metal connectors and you could see that they were scratched!! or if u may... used.. i kinda panicked... i looked at the SD adapter and it had no scratches... but the Micro sd card had sings of usage... i was like REALLY??! perhaps it has been benchmarked by the seller... which it should had been stated.. as refurbished cuz they are not marked like that BRAND NEW! Thereafter i went for some benchmarking myself and at first it seemed to be a rip off cuz i can only get close the 4MB per second (3.83MB/s to be exact).. i KNOW the MINIMUM for Class 4 its 4MB/s on the Transfer test... but i owned smaller size class 4 cards and they always OVER the 4 MB/s on the writing, i mean it totally depends on the type of file and the device but this myth its looking busted!! But On the Reading test it gets to up to 11MB/s but the 3.83MB/s writing kinda annoys me.. but this test its been done on my android... so .... i think before i come with a final conclusion i have to test it on a PC with a straight up card reader. >>>UPDATE: i tested it with a PC program and a straight up system adapter and i got the same.. the card seem to be struggling to stay on the 3MB/s on the writing with a 300MB file and it actually dropped to 2.45MB/s on writing at one time!! i dont care how fast the reading is.. this is going back to the seller. SELLER if u are reading this... UPDATE ur information to a more accurate description.. save some people time and headaches... if u sell this like this state it as .. Not on original packaging!!

Also why do I get a Sandisk adapter with a Kingston card???!hmmm...kinda fishy if you ask me. The item did not come in its original packaging but rather in a small clear plastic case like the off market chinese knockoffs you find on e-bay.

This product is the only exception to date, but it so horribly under performs that other potential customers deserve a warning. I bought this card to replace the 8GB Class2 Sandisk card that came with my HTC EVO. The first step to swapping out cards once I got them, was to transfer my files to my computer (I don't have 2 card readers). I used the adapter that came with the Kingston microSD card to plug my Sandisk microSD card into my computer and transferred all my files (about 3GB) to my a folder on my desktop. The Sandisk card gave a very respectable (for a class2 device) 4.5 MB/s transfer rate. When transferring the same files to the Kingston card using the same card adapter and SD slot, the transfer rate maxed out a 50 KB/s. It would have taken me more than 10 hours to transfer my files from my PC to the Kingston card. A Class 4 device should have a _minimum_ sustained write speed of 4 MB/s. I ordered this product fulfilled by Amazon, and I am sure Amazon is not sending me any knock-off products. The card, the packaging, everything look completely legitimate based on previous Kingston products I have bought. Luckily Amazon has a quick and easy refund policy. Bottom line. Don't waste you time on this, it is garbage."}

This chip is sold as 'new' but it didn't come in the manufacturer's retail packaging. Did I actually get a used product? Or does this seller buy in bulk and then repackage for resale? If the latter, then this seller should disclose the fact. If the former, well then... In any event the chip works for my purpose, so I'm giving 2 stars. I took three stars off because of the ambiguity regarding the packaging, and based on comments from other reviewers it seems clear that the authenticity of these chips is highly suspect. If you're looking for the cheapest price and are willing to take a chance, go ahead. If not, you should probably avoid this purchase.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."}

A minor issue people should realize, not with the memory card itself, is that above 2GB is considered high-capacity and only directly read by newer Vista computers and not other computers or scanner/copiers with card slots.

After visiting the official Kingston website for this card you will see that Amazon is a \"preferred online partner\" for the sale of this card. That absolutely DOES NOT include marketplace sellers. I can't stress enough the caution required to buy genuine flash memory. So please remember, only buy flash memory sold by AMAZON LLC. You will be able to see who is selling easily. Anyways, onto the review. I bought this for my HTC Flyer. Imediately after opening I ran a benchmark test using CrystalDiskMark and everything came out clear with true class 4 speed (4mb/s) a tested capacity of 7.4GB. I plugged it into my HTC Flyer and have noticed a huge increase in the speed of data transfer. (Upgraded from 2GB class 2) Otherwise I expect this card to perform admirably and I just ask that people be more careful in their online purchases."}

Where, I will run the RaspberryPi and if needed will transport it on my android device. In terms of storage and compatibility, the card performed as expected. It booted Raspbian and I could also take pictures with my phone. GREAT. However, after exactly 6 times, where the micro SD was removed to be placed on the phone and back into the adapter for the Pi. The card was not being read at all, and I made sure not to jam the micro card or place it incorrectly. Therein, I eliminate any operation error. After careful inspection I found out that the SDadapter had slightly shifted open. Which is caused by the use CHEAP plastic and bad tolerances. With this shift, the adapter pins could not make proper contact with the microSD card and therefore it didn't worked. Now, I am using a competitor brand adapter and the microSD card still works well. Although I live in constant fear of a sudden malfunction and loose of all my data, specially the one originated from the RaspberryPi. Will update in regards of the performance of the microSD card."}

After that, the phone could not sync via the USB cable. Testing confirmed the problem to be this card and the new OS update. Phone worked fine with no card at all and the update, worked fine with card and pre-update OS, but several tests and reinstalls confirmed the problem. I replaced this card with the class 4 32 gig from SanDisk, and it works reliably. I believe NoDo speeds up memory funcion in some way and this results in unreliable performance from this Kensington card. Further proof (and a possible saving grace) is that wireless sync still works with NoDo and this card. It's much slower than USB sync, of course, but my guess is that's why it still work. For Windows Phone 7, my suggestion is to stick with SanDisk, and pray a bit. After all, Microsoft and the phone manufacturers have only officially OKed one card (a SanDisk 8 gig) at this point anyway. We're all pirating a bit here, and that requires patience and planning."}

The mp3 player accesses, plays, and lists songs and audiobooks from this external memory as quickly if not more so than from the 2 GB built in. The price was very good, just as cheap as the competition. The MicroSD-to-SD adapter is nice to have and something many other brands don't come with. There seems to be some controversy here regarding this card. I have not performed speed tests or anything of that sort. My experience with this product has been nothing but positive.

I was not aware, but this is a common problem and when this happened to me, I had lots of pictures that were not retrievable at all.

It works great on my Nokia E71 and completes the phones memory with a much larger availability of storage. I have over 200 songs on the card now and it still isn't even close to being filled. Couple of things; this is a Class 4 with a minimum transfer speed of 4.0MB/s so its not the fastest card available (Class 6's can go up to 45.0MB/s, but since microSDHC cards seem to usually be reserved for cellphones there is really not much for need the increased speed. Considering the size of the card, it seems very easy to break or lose, which is something you should keep in mind if you have never used a microSD/HC card before. However, both the plastic for the adapter and the card itself feel relatively similar and durable as some more expensive memory cards that I own from Sony or Sandisk. Other than that, I can see no real discernible difference in quality nor functionality between this and some bigger name brands. I have used a variety of Kingston products and have never been disappointed by them; they seem to be a good company that offers a range of products at hard to beat prices."}

I rarely used the videocam and in May 2013, when we (finally) got smartphones, I installed it in my Samsung Galaxy 3s android phone. I woke this morning to a \"Removed SD Card / Insert SD Card\" message on my phone. The SD card is dead, kaput, like it doesn't exist. When I couldn't get it to remount on the phone I put it in my laptop to see if it could be read there. Nope. It doesn't even show up as being in the drive at all. Whatever makes it work, is just gone. I'm glad my photos are backed up to Dropbox or I'd be very upset. As it is, when I buy my new SD card, I won't be getting a Kingston, I'll stick to SanDisk (my husband has an identical phone but with a 32G SanDisk SD card and has never had a problem). Bottom line. Yes it will work and perhaps I just got a bad one or something but I won't be taking a chance and will stick with what I know will work reliably for longer than six months. UPDATE: Dec 14, 2013 -- Originally I rated this a 1 star for reasons indicated in the commentary above. The original review (above) is as it was first posted and the subject only edited to reflect the word UPDATED. I contacted Kingston as suggested by their company rep below. They replaced the SD card with a new one. The updated rating of 3 reflects the fact that I had to go out of pocket for return postage. While I understand the need for the return of the item (to avoid bogus claims from people who want a free card) The postage to return it as required in a padded envelope was over 10% of the price I originally paid for the product. The postage plus the cost of the required padded envelope were amounts I didn't feel I should have to pay in order to have a product replaced under warranty."}
{"Verified Purchase":true,"Star Rating":5,"Username":"Dan","Profile":"/gp/pdp/profile/ADC39K622BS6M","Helpful Votes":"2.0/2.0","Review":"Not sure what these are listed for right now, but prices were pretty stable around 12 bucks for awhile, when I got mine to go along with a new device that was capable of taking advantage of High Capacity Micro SD cards. I wasn't looking to spend a whole lot (actually around 12-14 dollars), and was hoping to find an 8GB one. Unfortunately, they were around 20 (still a good deal if you NEED 8GB), so I went with the 4GB. My regret is not regarding the size I got, actually, it is that I didn't learn more about what \"class\" meant in regards to to the cards. I now know it refers to speed, more specifically transfer speed. Essentially, for the people out there not too into the technical aspects, the higher the class number (4, 6, 8, etc) the faster the transfer speed of the card. For my current purposes, it's not a big deal, and noticeably faster than the regular MicroSD cards (I had a similar device before that was almost identical, but couldn't read the HC cards, and got a new one that could, which was just about the ONLY difference between the devices). However, anyone purchasing this for a higher end digital camera, or anything that would benefit from the ability to transfer information faster, should consider getting a higher \"class\" card, like a 6 or 8. They are only a little bit more expensive usually, but the speed difference CAN be noticeable if your device would be helped by additional transfer speed. Sorry if I repeated myself a bit, but I wanted to be clear and stress those points. But for a general purpose MicroSDHC card, it definitely is exactly what I was hoping for. One thing to note, it DOES come with an adapter, but NOT a High Capacity adapter. This won't make a difference if you're running Windows Vista, or can hook the device (with the card inside) directly to the computer. If you don't and can't, however, you might want to look into getting a card reader that reads HC cards, or just get a different product that DOES come with a High Capacity READER (they do exist, and ARE packaged with cards...again, usually just a bit more expensive). I hope this review helps answer any questions that weren't answered by the description; they cover the things I personally wasn't sure about when I ordered. Definitely a good product, though, so don't let the block-o-text scare you off."}

If it cost more than ten bucks, I might go to the trouble of the return process. I am confident that Kingston would exchange it for me, but it will cost me less to buy another one online or run into a local store at lunch time. I bet that if I bought another one it would work just fine, but this one was a disappointment. UPDATE: I did eventually get it to work, but only with my Mac. I needed to buy a new (updated) SD card reader. Windows XP would not work with the newer style reader. I suspect that all would be well with Windows 7"}

My feel to it is complicated. Pros: Big storage, Relative low price Cons: VERY SLOW. The Nexus One came with a Sandisk 2G Class 2 SD card. When connect the phone to computer and copy file to the SD card, I usually got 2~3 MB/s. Using the same way, this Kingston 16G CLASS 4 can only get 1.5MB/s, sometimes even less than 1MB/s. I did not try using a SD card reader, and it is not quite practical to use a SD reader for my routine, because for Nexus One, I have to take out the battery to take out the SD card, that's too much trouble.

But ... when I opened it up and put it into the adapter and plugged it in to my Mac, I tried to place my music on it and couldn't. Checking info showed it was set to \"Read Only.\" It wasn't a matter of the moveable tab on the adapter - it wasn't set in the locked position, and just to be sure it wasn't the adapter I tried another microSD card in it and that one worked fine. So, it was something with the original factory settings and I couldn't adjust it that way. A bit of searching on the internet led me to some people who suggested that some microSD cards can't be read except by digital devices. So what I ended up doing was plugging it into a camcorder I have, that uses microSD, and reformatting it from there. That worked fine, and after that I could plug it into the Adapter and plug it into my Mac and load music on it just fine. It's not a bad workaround, but kind of a pain that I had to figure it out that way. I can imagine I'd be really frustrated if I didn't own a device that could format it independently. I don't understand why it doesn't come formatted as read/write capable from the get go. Every other microSD card I've owned has worked fine right out of the package."}

My tablet doesn't get a lot of heavy use, but I do occasionally watch a movie or use an app on it, and for those, you need an SD card. It came in a thick paper envelope, about the size of a small greeting card, and not padded. The packaging disappointed me at first, however that was before I saw how it was packaged inside. [...] The bubble packaging was made in such a way as to perfectly secure everything separately. I was rather impressed, as once I cut the tape holding it shut, the package opened easily, but still gave a slight snap when reclosing it. This was obviously well thought out, and will make for a great carrying case for the instructions + adapter. The SD card as well if I ever replace the card for a larger one. I'm sure anyone reading this knows the perils of dropping one of these Micro SD cards. Moving on, once inserting the SD card into my tablet, I found it came pre-formatted and completely blank. I've only had SD cards included with phones and the such, so I was half expecting some sort of bloatware that needed to be cleared, but there is none. Is there usually? I have no idea. But if you were wondering, there isn't. The SD card works great, allowing video playback and app usage just as I had hoped. I haven't had any issues with it, and I didn't really expect any. My only complaint is with the instructions. They had to do it this way due to the packaging, however the text is incredibly small. I'm talking fine print on a contract small. You can read it squinting and looking close, however it is annoying. Oh and one last thing. It includes a lifetime limited warranty. It only covers defects, but I'll take it!"}

The solution was quite simple.....simiply re-format the card to fat-32 again and you should be able to use it in all compatible devices. Very Very strange....but it worked in the Blackberry this time around. I have always liked kingston products and their memory cards....so I am giving this a 4/5 due to the tiny little formatting issue.

Over the years I have almost exclusively used Kingston memory and many of the old chips I have will most likely work if I ever had to use them again. Memory has really progressed over the years and as motherboards and processors evolve so does the RAM. The evolution of the devices is the only reason I have had to change my RAM modules. From the old 256mb chips, RAMBUS, DDR2 and DDR3, all have done their jobs. I recommend Kingston products for their warranty and performance."}

I'm currently using it with the adapter inside my point-and-shoot camera, and it works well and doesn't cause big delays between shots.

A few months ago I decided to scan and save every important document that my family has (passports, birth certificates etc.). Knowing a thing or two about data security and the methods of hackers, I know that storing those documents on a computer connected to the internet (or even a hard-drive that I connect to said computer every now and then) is a bad idea to say the least. I don't hang out in the wrong places and I have a decent amount of security on my computers, but no system is impregnable! I decided that a microSD card (and backup) was the way to go. They are tiny, making them easily hidden! I'm only including the following in case anyone might find it useful, if you don't feel like reading my methodology, just know that I'm pleased with the card and would highly recommend it! Step 1: Remove wireless card and hard-drive from laptop Step 2: Install new hard-drive Step 3: Install TAILS Linux Operating System Step 4: Scan all documents to new hard-drive Step 5: Encrypt all files using freeware TrueCrypt program Step 6: Save all encrypted files to microSD card Step 7: Make backup to second MicroSD card Step 8: Put MicroSD cards in separate, secure places, safe from fire/heat damage and theft Step 9: Perform secure delete of all files from hard-drive using shred command Step 10: Set laptop back to normal and perform full erase of hard-drive. Yes, the above method seems a little paranoid - but after having seen repositories of personal information just like this for sale on the internet, there's no such thing as being too safe. I now have two digital copies of all important documents in two very secure locations. Even if the cards were compromised, the FBI couldn't break a TrueCrypt encryption after a year of trying, so I'm not too worried about some l33t hacker on Arch. By being tiny, MicroSD cards are easily hidden and can even be placed inside mundane objects with relative ease. I'm very pleased with these Kingston MicroSD cards - it's not the fastest way to transfer data, but it is absolutely fine for data storage and cell phone use. Highly recommended!"}

Once you've got the product, though...it was a real PITA to open it since it was wrapped tightly with a sticky, plastic label that required a scissor to open it without destroying the packaging.

The \"Class\" designation refers to the data transfer rate. I believe that the Garmin units can accept up to a Class 12, so the Class 4 works just fine. In doubt?? Call Garmin TS! They're the experts. Why do you need one? Great question. As the GPS market continues to expand the map vendors will be providing more detailed map information and data to the GPS vendors. The Nuvi 1450 LMT includes lifetime map updates. I would prefer to have all of my map data stored in the GPS unit and not on my HDD. Additionally, although the map updates usually include all of North America, you may not need all of this map data. You can also store pictures but not MP3 files or audio books in the memory in the GPS unit. This product is well designed and constructed. It is just as described on the Amazon website. It's a bargain at $11.99."}

They produce the most reliable memory out there. I will not buy any other kind of RAM, regardless of price. Naturally, when I needed to upgrade the MicroSD flash card that came with my phone, I checked into Kingston first. I was a little concerned that there appear to be TWO versions of this card floating around: one made in Japan that is reputed to be superior and one made elsewhere (maybe Taiwan or Thailand?) that is supposed to have problems. I was relieved to receive one that was made in Japan. The swap went uneventfully, and my new 16GB card was recognized immediately. I copied all my files to it, and the performance was spot on for a class 4 card (I got write speeds consistenly in the 4.5 MB to 5 MB per second range). Read speeds are a little faster, more in the range of 5 MB to 6 MB per second, plenty fast for movies and media in general. Part of the performance is the phone (or whatever device) itself, so keep in mind these are MY numbers in MY device, your mileage may vary. But what I can say for sure is that the card itself definitely performs to specifications, which cannot be said of many memory cards out there. I have had this card in operation daily for a little over a month now, and it has performed flawlessly. I have had zero problems with it. I would heartily recommend it, especially since it is competitively priced with the other no-name or wierd-name options. Get the Kingston and have the best."}

I haven't seen a Micro SD be used for a digital camera device yet, so I'll guess it's mostly these PDA type devices that they are being purchased for. Buyer beware! If your PDA device specifically states it can only support up to 2gb in the expansion memory slot, then anything over that size may not work. I bought this 4gb Kingston Micro SD with adapter for a Motorola Moto Q9h (AT&T), and it failed to recognize the Micro SD. It detected it, and let me know how much memory was there, but it would give me an error and would NOT allow me to save to it, or open the file I had on it. So, I sent the Moto Q9h back and replaced with a Blackberry Curve 8300, which also stated that it had an expansion slot which would support up to a 2gb Micro SD. However, I tested it with another Blackberry 8300 model and it worked. So, make sure that the Micro SD you're buying will work with your device. The safest bet is to go into the store and try it on your device. The other thing, Motorola has failed in all aspects to compete in the PDA phone market. If you're thinking of buying a PDA phone device, avoid the Motorola. It failed in many way than just the expansion slot not working. I think the Windows Mobile OS was the other problem."}

The best feature i liked about this product is the adapter. When I first opened the package, I dint think it would ve been this useful. Whenever I want to transfer something like pictures or music to my phone I transfer the card inside the small slot of the adapter which is quite cute and then insert the adapter to the memory card slot in my laptop. I doesnt require any installation or waiting. You can transfer just about anything from the computer to the card (depending on what device you use)and vice versa just by dragging and dropping. I still have around 75% disk space left in my card after having around 100 songs and some pictures. The reason why I like the adapter offer is because I have just inserted the adapter into the memory card slot and kept it there always. So whenever I wanted to transfer something all I do is insert my SD card into the adapter and transfer the data and then put it back into the phone. It may take just less than 2 minutes to do that! Bottomline is: Go for this offer with adapter instead of buying the card alone. It may become useful even if you dont use it often. Really a good product and for such a low price you will never regret it even if something happens."}

After adding it to my Blackberry Tour, the card has given me plenty of space to store my media and pictures. Performance: While the Blackberry is nowhere near as demanding from a read/write speed standpoint as a legitimate digital camera is, this card performs just fine in terms of expanding the space available to saving media. Fit and Finish: Perfect. Support: Kingston backs their memory products up with a Lifetime Warranty so should something go wrong, which is incredibly unlikely, they will be there to provide any necessary support. Amazon's Frustration-Free Packaging: This could be the best attribute of this purchase. Amazon has really gotten packaging right with their new Frustration-Free option. Gone are the horrendous clamshell packages manufacturers so frequently use for products like this. In addition, the new packaging is far more ecologically friendly which is nice as well. I am very happy Amazon has taken strides forward in improving not only the shopping experience online, but also the experience once a product arrives in the purchaser's home.

However a couple of weeks ago it stopped working. When I did the RMA, Kingston would only do so after I returned the card to them first. I went through the RMA procedure on the phone with them, but it wasn't made clear to me that I had to return their defective unit first. I know that Kingston is a reputable company, but in previous dealings with Kingston where I was expected to return something, I never got the replacement once I sent the item back (granted, this was many years ago and it involved a Kingston NIC) I think Kingston should collect a customer's CC# and send them a replacement card and then have the customer send back the defective unit and re-use the packaging that Kingston sent in. At a current cost of $16.00 I'd need to purchase a special envelope @$4.00 and send it to Kingston @ a cost of roughly $2.00. For an additional $10.00 I can purchase another 32GB card. Virtually every other company of this type will offer to replace the device and place a CC# hold to cover the cost of the device. or AT LEAST send the customer an appropriate pre-paid package to avoid this in the future. I'm now going to purchase a 32GB Sandisk MicroSD."}

My computer has no trouble recognizing it as a drive. I also tried it in my Sony Cybershot Camera using a microSDHC to MS PRO Duo Adapter -- works like a charm; the camera has no trouble capturing pictures and videos (at 30 fps). All of my devices are able to recognize the full capacity of the SD card. This SD card is rated class 4 (data transfer rate: 4 MByte/sec, or 32 Mbps) - sufficiently fast for the majority of electronics. A decidedly small number of electronics, most notably some camcorders and high-end cameras, require a class 6 SD card (the fastest transfer rate). I searched the Internet extensively for a better price - Amazon's price [...] for this microSDHC card can't be beat! Rest assured, you're getting a great microSD card at a great price!"}

Less than a year later it has become unstable. What a rip-off!. It will just disappear and unmount itself on both my phone and my Linux machine. I was barely able to keep it mounted long enough (few tries) to copy all my data to my PC so I could migrate to a new (and different brand) memory card for my phone. Note: Since migrating to a new Sansdisk microSD, my phone has been stable, whereas it had gotten to the point that it wouldn't even recognize the Kingston card anymore. This proves it was not the phone. I have also witnessed similarly low reliability in a second EVO 4G handset running on the 16 GB version of this Kingston class 4 microSD. I recommend buying a different brand."}

I expected to get 4MB/sec, and instead, when copying a big file to the device, it wrote out at nearly 10MB/sec. Read speed was 20MB/sec. I was using this in an elago Mobile Nano II which fits flush in my laptop's USB port so I never have to remove it. Since this is a microSDHC, you can only format these with FAT32, but that's just fine since NTFS is about 6X slower on USB sticks so you'd never want to format flash memory with NTFS anyway! So I use 4GB for ReadyBoost on Windows 7 (which is the most you can do for 4GB) and use the other 4GB for file storage for stuff I'm actively working on. I couldn't be happier with the combination of this card and the elago adapter. This is the ideal solution if you want to add ReadyBoost to your laptop. You simply cannot beat it!"}

In the camera, it also showed up as less than 50 mb capacity, but after formatting, it showed up with 7.4 gb capacity.

When playing a track/song, there is a pause before the song is played. It takes probably 3 or 4 seconds for the track to play. This also happens when switching tracks. I kind of doubt this is the cards fault, but probably is from the phone. I don't think this should stop you from purchasing this card, but you might want to take this in consideration if you decide to get a Samsung Eternity phone.

In any case, my card also has about 7.5 GB available, but it works great so I recommend it. I am using it in a Nokia e71x smart phone from AT&T.

It only touches 3.4 after a long build up. I have a non class rated Sandisk that is blowing it out of the water at around 5.5 MB/s. This is using the same file, same adapter when testing. The numbers show this during file transfer via Windows 7 AND during a test using H2testw program.

I bought it to expand the memory of my Samsung Galaxy S4. It doubled it's memory space... which is perfect because I'm used to taking a lot of pictures and videos, plus I download music to it. It's not expensive at all... mostly when I saw this same product at the store for $30! I highly recommend it if you need to expand your device's memory -Android or Tab-."}

It was a fairly simple process to transfer the data over from my old card and then, after plugging it into my phone, everything came right back up after a few minutes. Furthermore, the card worked fine even after I rooted my phone and installed the Cyanogen Mod, so I'm pretty confident in this card's reliability. Overall, it's a good deal."}

Very quick standard delivery. Reason for a 4 rating rather than a 5 -- S&H cost excessive as usual (65 cents USPS charge / $4.70 total). Installed in my Nook eReader and was recognized / ready immediately. Reason for NOT going with the \"free\" card reader bundle -- Another, additional, excessive S&H cost."}

When inserted into the multiple devices I tried it on, none of them were able to read the card. It's not really a huge problem because I had other adapters that worked with the card. Still, for the price I think it was well worth it."}

This one is only 7.21 GB compared to my other cards which are 7.42 GB. The is annoying when you backup Raspberry Pi images because none of my 8 GB image files can be stored on these cards because there is not enough room. I guess if you only buy these cards then it doesn't matter or for a camera these cards should be OK. When using the adapter the cards seem slower."}

Buy from Amazon direct or someone who fulfills through Amazon. Be careful of third party sellers- for this and any other SD card sold on Amazon Marketplace. Quite a few aren't genuine. Also, be sure to check the prices on this type of media. I got a bunch of these sold by Amazon a while back for $5 each. That's a decent price. $8 or more (which is what it's currently going for) is not. The card themselves are good. They're not what I'd call super fast but they're fine for shooting 720p video and taking pictures. Most smartphones and tablets will work just fine with one of these. If you're shooting from a DSLR or full HD camcorder, you probably want at least a class 6. Kingston makes good memory, but unfortunately is one of the more prevalent faked brands (the others being ADATA and Samsung). They'd probably add some sort of security feature to their product if it was worth doing so, but these are so cheap it would probably kill their profit margin."}

Kingston brand and another, lesser known brand. The Kingston went into my husband's LG 800G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone) and was recognized as external memory immediately (3.4 GB - not 4 GB, but that was expected as there is always some space loss due to operating system access). The included adapter worked as it should too, allowing me to load music onto the card from my Windows PC. By contrast, the other brand ( Patriot LX PRO Series Class 10 40MB/s UHS-1 32GB MicroSD Card at a faster speed and bigger size, had issues. Kingston is a brand of quality memory products that I've used since building PC's in the 90's to present day. This product, like other SD and flash drives by Kingston that I currently own, is excellent quality and as described. Don't hesitate to buy it if you want a microSD card that works as it should, out of the box."}

It was mounted on saturday, why is it unmounted on sunday? At first I thought it was some kind of OTA update that crippled Sd card function. When I went home, I decided to test some of my old memory cards. They worked. I purchased the IO Gear card reader/writer. It read my older cards just fine. Not the Kingston 16GB. Nothing, Nada.

Just to be clear, you are buying the tiny flash card to the right in the picture, and it plugs into the big card on the left (which does come with), so that it can do double duty in both standard SD and microSD.

The cards are a little slow, but are fast enough for the 1920x1080 60FPS video setting of the GoPro Hero 3 Black. And of course they work in the Hero 3 White as it tops out at 1920x1080 30FPS.

Thank goodness I did because I ended up getting the phone wet, and upon receiving my replacement phone all of my pictures were intact! I highly recommend this card. Also, I had about 3k pictures plus other items saved to this card and it wasn't even half full. It's a good capacity to grow with and secure place to store photos. I still recommend using Google Photos to back up your photos on wifi regardless. I know so many people that lose their phones and lose all their pictures as well. This can be easily avoided!"}

I bought the 16GB card. The micro SD card, slides into a slot on the cell phone that is UNDER the battery (not convenient, I know). Once the card is in place and the battery reinserted and cover snapped back on and locked, turn on the phone. Now, enter \"Media Center\", then \"Pictures and Videos\", and finally \"My Pictures. Next, click on \"Options\" bottom right. Then click on \"Manage Pictures\". Now select \"Move to Card\". You will now be able to mark one (which you may want to do to test the process - see more below) or \"mark all\" pictures that you want moved to the micro SD card. Once you select \"done\" (bottom left of screen), you will be asked if you want the pictures moved to your card. Select \"Yes\" and the process begins. It should only take a few seconds for one picture and 30 to 40 seconds if you have, say 20 pictures or more. You may want to just move one picture, as a test. Once you have done this, then remove the micro SD card (try pushing it in first to unlock it), place it in the micro SD card reader, place this in your computer's SD card slot. If you have a PC, your computer will prompt you in how to open the picture. You can then save it to whatever folder you like. If you have a Mac, after placing the micro SD card reader into the computer's SD card slot, open up \"Finder\". You should see the SD card reader listed as an unknown device (look down the left side of computer screen). Click on the unknown device and you will see the pictures folder appear. Click on the pictures folder to view the pictures you have saved to the micro SD card. You can repeat the process to save videos and all of your contacts from your phone to the micro SD card."}

I transferred our old 2GB cards from our old phones to start. Mine worked fine, but my wife's phone kept erasing and unformating the card. A quick online search indicated that this was a rather common problem, and one reviewer suggested that the Class 4 cards worked far better than the newer, higher class, cards. So I bought two, tossed out the old smaller cards, and these do, indeed, work fine. (It seems to be an issue of data transfer speed from the phone to the card.) If anyone checks this review over this specific issue, I would suggest getting the cards before they become unavailable--if that should be the case."}

Furthermore, something goes so horribly wrong that: A) It causes a fatal error in the camera itself that cannot be resolved without resetting the camera and formatting the internal memory, and B) It spontaneously ejects itself from the slot in the camera, even with the door to the card compartment closed and locked. Both are likely because it is, quite simply, flimsy and poorly made. The \"lock\" latch slips around with absolutely no traction at all, the plastic is flimsy, the microSD card does not seat firmly into the adapted (but rather just nestles loosely). The text on the adapter is also of such poor print quality that it makes me wonder if it's a cheap knock-off or counterfeit. I will not be using Kingston microSD ever again after this. One bad card is a random error, but two is a failure on their part."}

{"Verified Purchase":true,"Star Rating":1,"Username":"R.","Profile":"/gp/pdp/profile/A2YXBO1HO3O243","Helpful Votes":"0.0/0.0","Review":"I bought this SD card for my phone in May of 2013 and it just randomly stopped working in Dec. I've been procrastinating on buying a new one because I've been hopeful that I could recover the images or at the very least reformat it...nope and nope. Can't recover any of my pics, can't reformat, can't even get my comp to recognize its presence as a drive when plugged in. So I came to Amazon to finally reorder another card and then I see that other reviewers have had the same problem. Not only did their cards also randomly stop working, they contacted Kingston and found out they had received a fake card that was designed to work for a short period of time and then fail. Rather pissed to find out that Amazon is still selling the product if there are fakes throughout their inventory. Especially since I read a review where someone directly notified Amazon of the problem. I haven't contacted Kingston to verify whether or not my SD card is indeed a fake because I don't have the time/patience for all that, but I'm suspicious considering the fact that other SD cards I've had for years have never done this and there was no error on my part that could have caused the card to fail (i.e. I did nothing different to the card and it was just in my phone as usual when it failed). Sigh...it seems I will have to trek all the way to Best Buy to purchase my next SD card to avoid getting another fake from Amazon. Hopefully Best Buy's stock isn't laced with failures as well."}

Take the sd micro, put it in the full size adapter, and plug it into a computer. From there format specifically as fat32. Fat32 is a filesystem most phones support where or not they will format an sd micro as such.

It worked great for a while. Then today its just stopped working. She lost all her pictures, music,and videos. At first we thought it was her phone but we tried using it with its reader on two different laptops with no good results. the laptops didn't pick it up. we were so desperate that we even tried it on her television usb slot but nothing. I went to the Kingston website for tech support and I read that these SD cards tend to mess up on Android 4.1 & 4.2 devices. So if anyone is getting it for there Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, or Samsung Galaxy Note II please beware of this, because you might loose your important documents when it becomes unresponsive. If anyone has it already, make sure you back it up and start thinking about getting a new one not of this brand."}

My main use is to store my extensive music collection by artist. For example, this will easily fit a ten disc set of Oscar Peterson's music titled Kind of Peterson, along with 7 Classic Albums - Oscar Peterson, plus additional albums. For some artists I need two of these, and for some I have room to spare, The adapter allows me to use this in an EasyAcc CSR Bluetooth Speakers with USB Flash & SD Card Playing, as well as from my laptop. I have tried this in my Samsung Galaxy Note II phone and it was immediately recognized and mounted. The write speed is a tad slow, but the read speed is fast enough to stream music and video. The bottom line, though, is the price of quality SD storage in the smaller capacity cards like this one has fallen. That means that you can use them for building a digital library that can be sub classified or grouped by artist, author or actor depending on what you are storing. Moreover, this makes a great back-up for weekly snapshots of documents, or photos."}

{"Verified Purchase":true,"Star Rating":5,"Username":"L. G. CHARLOT","Profile":"/gp/pdp/profile/A3BACUOZV1M0WM","Helpful Votes":"0.0/0.0","Review":"I purchased this card specifically for use in a Garmin Oregon handheld GPS. It is a class IV, so speed wise it is not a blazing fast performer, and is probably best for \"static\" data applications like storing MP3 music in a media player or cell phone, or maps in a GPS (which is what I bought it for). By \"static\", I mean applications where the device is mostly only reading data and not writing much. This card will also work well in smaller or older digital cameras of 12 megapixels or less, for still photography or VGA video (640 x 480). Class IV cards like this will almost certainly NOT work for high-def video. As a camera card, I would only use Kingston or Transcend cards with caution. I have only experienced a few SD card failures in digital cameras since switching from film to digital in 2003, but both were from Kingston and Transcend cards. I have never had a Sandisk card give me any problems in a camera. Using these lower priced cards for music or GPS mapping data is not going to pose a problem since you have (or should have) the data backed up on your main computer at home. If a card fails, just buy a new one (8 gb cards are dirt cheap) and re-write the data. But a failure of a card in a camera, say on a once-in-a-lifetime vacation, is another matter - you don't want to take any risks with an economy priced memory card when the same sized Sandisk card is probably only a couple dollars more. SUMMARY: A budget priced 8gb class 4 micro-SD card with an adapter, so you can use it in almost any device that takes either Micro or Regular SD cards. Works well for read-only applications like music or GPS mapping where you only write the data to the card once, but use with caution in digital cameras, especially for critical photography where a card failure would be a major calamity. This card is NOT SUITABLE for high def video (resolution more than 640 x 480 at 30 fps). The Amazon Frustration-free packaging is nice: much easier to open than a typical heat sealed blister pack."}

Just a couple of complaints: one of the Micro SD to SD adapter's outer contacts are a little uneven, so it takes a little negotiating to get it into my card reader without damaging anything; also, neither of them came with the reusable plastic storage cases...just some disposable plastic packaging. But for the price, I'm satisfied."}

{"Verified Purchase":true,"Star Rating":5,"Username":"Daisy \"Daisy S\"","Profile":"/gp/pdp/profile/ABDR6IJ93HFIO","Helpful Votes":"0.0/0.0","Review":"Well I have to admit that read quite a few of these review before purchasing two of these Kingston 16GB Micro SD cards with SD Adapter. For the low price I paid for two cards, I went ahead and purchased these cards. They arrived in the actual Kingston Retail package with the SD Adapter and these cards are a class four, which is not the fastest. However, I am very pleased with the cards because I copied quite a lot of pictures, home videos and more to the cards and in my opinion they did not seem that slow at all. Since I did not time the speed, I just let the paste process begin and kept on with my computer typing, web browsing etc. Before I knew it, these files were copied to the SD cards. Inserted them into some older (backup) phones (that I also use as very rugged music players) and so far, so good. Every file has read, every tune played and every photo and home movie is perfect stored on the cards. So for me, I am happy with this purchase. Keep in mind what the other reviewer wrote about safely removing the Android phone's old SD card before inserting a new one, this is so true. Also I find for me that if I simply turn off the phone and remove the old card and then replace the new one, the phone reads the new one fine."}

The first couple of updates went off without a hitch, but last year I got an error message informing me I could only update part of the map due to storage limitations. Same thing this year, but much more extreme - I was only going to be able to get a regional map, which was not acceptable. Rather than succumb to the pressure to buy a new device, I purchased this flash card and was able to successfully complete my update. Hopefully this will be sufficient for a few more years. I know more people are using their smartphones for GPS these days, but since I already have the device, and don't want to burn through my data plan, this is a good option."}

But if you are in need of a brand name card that works fine just to store some data you can't go wrong with this."}

They immediately opened a case number, asked me to email a copy of my Amazon receipt showing Amazon was the seller & then mail them back the card and adapter. It cost approx $3 to mail from Northern Ca to Southern Ca (incl 55cents for a bubble envelope). The entire process from return to receiving replacement took about 3wks and was detailed online. They never mentioned anything about needing to verify authenticity of the card as it was an Amazon purchase (NOT a \"fulfilled by Amazon\" and sold by someone else) and Amazon is one of their retailers. The people at Kingston were really nice & the warranty is lifetime for the original owner so I added 1-star, but the fact this thing died in a year still means I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Update: I originally gave this a 4-star but after 1yr in my Samsung S4 for only camera photos & music (any internet downloads or screenshots stayed separated on the phone's hard drive bc I'm leary of viruses) this card started freezing when trying to open photos, program started crashing when trying to load photos from the card, and one day it started saying \"card not detected.\" I'd take out, and reload and it worked for a little while then after a week. NOTHING. Screen flashed \"no SD card detected.\" Tried loading it in my computer to reformat but it doesn't detect the card either. It died after 1yr, 70photos, and 20songs. I think it actually died on its \"birthday.\" *smh* At least I had the common sense to back up my card and it happened before the 3 weddings and a vacation I have this summer. =/ This was a 32g ordered direct from Amazon. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Arrived quickly & in the same packaging you'd get in the stores but at a much lower price. I didnt call kingston to verify its authenticity, but I didn't feel I needed to. Both my samsung gs4 & my macbook pro recognized the unit immediately and the 32g (approx 29 useable) made me hate the s4 less..man I miss my iphone. Anyway, there isn't much else to say about it, its an sd, ive never \"loved\" an sd, maybe this review will change after ive had it a yr or two if nothing goes wrong. I bought direct from Amazon and had it about 3 months."}

Got this to be a multi-purpose flash card. It was really fast when I first started using it (60 - 80 MB / s or so, I think, but that's just a ballpark based on a few operations). As a side-note: I use Ubuntu Linux 13.04 and I tried out Ext4 and encryption on this using the GNOME Disks utility (mainly to test it out before encrypting my larger external drive). It slowed down considerably when using Nautilus to copy/update files. rsync through the terminal still gave decent write speeds, though."}

Second, they said it was delivered, closed out my order on Amazon and everything, when it hadn't been. I was disappointed to say the least and decided to give it one more day before losing my cool and calling customer service or writing an e-mail to raise unholy hell on these people. It was delivered the next day. So don't panic if this happens to you. Lastly, the biggest pet peeve of mine of this order is that they shipped this TINY little MICRO USB card...in a regular small manila envelope. No packaging, no cushioning, no box, just a flat envelope. So not cool. If it had been stepped on or smashed under another much heavier box, the card would have been destroyed. Those are my reasons for giving them only three stars. Otherwise, I have no complaints. The drive works great, does what I need it to do and is exactly what they said it would be. I'm content with this purchase but probably won't buy from them again. :\\"}

Interestingly, although the BB showed 8GB with the new card, I only saw 4GB (3.2 or 3.4GB usable) when I first connected to my laptop and the computer asked to format the card when I enabled Mass Storage Mode (I used this mode to drag and drop into the BB). I could only see 4GB on my work computer as well. However, after standalone reformatting the card (to FAT32) on my friends Compaq both of my computers (and phone) now properly see it as an 8GB card.

It brought me back to the first time I bought additional RAM for my Apple in the early 90's; a whopping $100 per MB (NOT a typo)! Around the same time, my son's Godmother was having a PC built for her with a 1GB hard drive (my MAC hard drive, at the time, was at 750MB). I remember asking her why a whole Gigabyte, as she couldn't possibly EVER need that much storage? Who knew? How things do change over time.

So, I called Kingston directly and they were so nice about it, they replaced the card and even paid for the shipping. Even though it probably costs 10 cents to produce one of these cards, the fact is they have great customer support and know how to make their customers happy. Having said that, I definitely recommend this card. Thanks Kingston!"}

Nevertheless after doing that it has worked perfectly since then. Just a hassle in the beginning for us."}

{"Verified Purchase":true,"Star Rating":3,"Username":"Patrick","Profile":"/gp/pdp/profile/A1GADTICIC0AOC","Helpful Votes":"0.0/0.0","Review":"I cannot give this product an awful rating, as it is most likely that this particular card was defective, but would hope for better quality. The SD card worked great in my phone (Samsung Galaxy S3). I mainly used it for music, but it could hold a movie if I wanted to watch one. However, after about three or four months, I woke up to a notification saying that the SD card was being removed and re-inserted. I tried it in my computer and it could not find any media when I attempted to repartition it, so I can confirm that it was definitely the SD card that is defective. I am somewhat disappointed, but at the same time you get what you pay for - one cannot expect much from a $7 SD card. Nevertheless, when purchasing a replacement, I will be cautious and may choose a more popular brand."}

{"Verified Purchase":true,"Star Rating":5,"Username":"Veil_Lord","Profile":"/gp/pdp/profile/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","Helpful Votes":"0.0/0.0","Review":"I've grown somewhat fond of Kingston over the past three years. The routinely by far the cheapest supplier. This card was no exception, coming in much cheaper than some other brands I was looking at. However don't expect any kind of frills; all you will get is the memory card and the SD adapter. You will not get any kind of solid storage case. As I've often found with Kingston, the memory seems slower than other brands. Considering what I'm using it for, a camera and possibly a tablet, maybe a cell phone, I really have no need to blazing fast speed. This card should work sufficiently and I'm quite happy. Just a note, you're probably better off purchasing directly from Amazon. When it comes to flash memory and even some hard disks there's a very high rate of counterfeit materials. If you see a deal that's too good to be true, it usually is and you could end up with a faulty card you can't get data off of."}

Microsoft suggests that you use a USB drive to do this, but it really just needs something that can be mounted as a different drive. Unfortunately, the Surface RT did not allow either microSDHC to be loaded with the restore partition. I'm not really sure why that is (perhaps a bug in Windows RT or perhaps they have an oddly strict requirement of truly being a USB drive), but they both worked in the Surface Pro. The reason that I gave it three stars was not because they did not work in the Surface RT, but rather because they were the slowest SD cards that I have ever used. It works for something that I hope to not have to use very frequently, but I would not buy this again due to how slow it is (feels slower than what I expected from a Class 4 card)."}

This is very handy when editing video, files, etc. I have since switched to the Micro SD to use as ID and Information tags on my pets, especially one cat in particular that wanders off for a month at a time. The SD card will fit on his tag, but the micro SD will fit on the collar itself. As far as quality, it appears to work just as well as the larger version."}

I mean, it's so small that you can easily lose it if you're not paying attention. I've had it for over 2 months and been using it daily and so far so good. It does write slowly so be patient when transferring files-other than that, it works great! I'm able to store over 4 full movies or a couple of tv series in HD, pictures and music with me when traveling so it has been a godsend. It has freed up valuable space on my limited 16GB Nexus 7 tablet!"}

The only problem I have had with it is that it is so tiny - but I guess you can't make a large MicroSD card. :-) Actually, I am using it in a dashboard camera, and the videos are coming out very clear with no problem, so I can only assume it is working well. It transferred quickly and easily to my computer at an expected speed. It is nice to have the adapter, but in order to keep from dropping it, I am using the cord that came with the camera to transfer the data. This keeps me from having to handle the card. No problems ... works as expected."}

For that service alone, they get all my business. Maybe I've been lucky, but I never have had a card fail on me."}

I bought 2 of these, (16GB) one for me and one for a friend, as he just got a new Galaxy phone and needed an SD card with a lot of space. It works great on his phone, as he can store all kinds of files on it, and mine works fine as a storage device for all my games. The SD card does seem to be rather average on transfer speed, but then again I'm not too judgmental on speed, due to the fact that I look for reliability and storage space the most. I am now a fan of Kingston and its products, and will definitely buy more whenever the time comes."}

File transfer on my PC would show that the files have been copied onto the card, and I did confirm the files were on the card. However, when I put the card back it in my tablet, the card would not show any files. This happened repeatedly. I had no issues with an 8GB San Disk or a 32 GB Transcend microSD cards that I have.

Everything worked fine and the data was transferred to my card and worked on my phone. I hooked it up a second time to add more items to the card but the computer would not detect there was a card inserted. I tried to put it in several cameras in hopes I could transfer the data through there but both different name brand cameras said \"No Card Inserted\" I finally decided to switch the adapter card. I put my 8 gb micro sd card into a SANDISK adapter and everything worked fine. This could be because of kingston's loose fit adapter cards or simply poor quality, but one thing is for SURE. DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY!"}

Update: While it worked very sluggish in my Nook HD for some reason after formatting it in the device twice it ran just fine in my vizio tablet. What the cause was Im not sure. I know some motherboards just don't like a particular type of memory in them. Maybe some devices are the same way with sd cards? Not sure what the issue was but I just swapped the cards from my Nook hd and my V-tab and they are both working well. Anyway as you can see from the other comment Kingstons customer service is exceptional even when you don't contact them! That's definitely a plus!!!"}

I have used other products on the market today for compact storage, these cards are great bang for your buck. That being said, there are better cards with faster speeds, but you will pay for them, in this case you get what you pay for and WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) and that is inexpensive storage with good quality, and an average speed, worthy of a purchase for upgrading cellphone, tablet or MP3 player memory capacity as well as any amateur camera applications!

One of them has been through homelessness, storage shelters, subjected to extreme heat and other harsh environments, but functions just as well as the day I bought it. This particular card is a class 4, which means it will be slower than a class 6 or higher. If you want a faster card, buy a higher class card. I tested this card and got a write speed of 4 and a read speed of 6 - 7, so it is likely legit and not a counterfeit (I'll note that I got mine supplied directly through Amazon, instead of one of the smaller electronics shops that sell through Amazon). I would recommend this card to anyone who wants a budget 32 gig flash card, but I would also make sure I was buying it directly from Amazon."}

The netbook takes SD or SDHC cards, and the tablet takes micro SD or micro SDHC cards. The micro SDHC with SD adapter allows me to use one card in either device. I use both devices to show videos, which are quite storage intensive. I have so far stored 43 videos (12Gb) to the card, used the card in both devices, and I haven't experienced any problems whatsoever. I read the reviews complaining about counterfeit cards, and the reviewers indicate failure at 2Gb or 4Gb. My card has been filled well past those points, and my Linux Desktop PC's file browser indicates that it's a 31Gb volume with 19Gb free. I will be ordering another one of these cards to have one for both the netbook and the tablet."}

I am sure that the phone company probably charged him $20 for the two gig chip, & wanted to charge him $10 more each month for internet storage, when the chip is only $6 one time.

Sometimes it wouldn't allow him to take pictures with his camera. Sometimes it wouldn't save the pictures. Sometimes it would only save a thumbnail of the pictures and not the actual picture. About a month after we put the card in his phone his phone began to say SD card damaged, needs to be reformatted. Won't buy a kingston sd card again!"}

I was tired of receiving messages on my phone that I didnt have enough storage space for app updates. I have been using it for about a week and no issues to report. It works great and all my files transferred over. In case you dont know, you have to back up the files saved on your phone prior to inserting the new card. There is probably a better way to do this but here is what I did. Connect your phone via USB cord as a disk drive to your PC. Copy the files and save as a folder on your PC. Turn off the phone and insert new SD card into phone. Turn phone back on then cut and paste backup folder from PC to the phone disk drive. Delete the folder from your PC after all the files have transferred to phone. Apologize if these directions seem confusing but you can always use Google for clearer instructions."}

I want to put all my pics on a card so I would have them all & could print what I wanted. The price was a great value especially for the Kingston name. The only thing that I would say is a very slight downside is if I choose to save my images right to the card instead of the phone there is a lag in between taking pics. It is faster if I just save them to my phone first & then transfer to the card when I am all done, other than that---great item. Would not hesitate to purchase again. Thank You =0)"}

The smart phone can play MP4 movies as well as a some other audio and video formats. The MP3 audios play well using the Class 4 (4MB/s) card. Conversely, the videos, despite extensive experimentation with MP4 quality and sub-format variations, continue to pause on occasion. Before the purchase, a friend recommended that I not buy anything less than a Class 8 for use in a smart phone. I can be a bit cheap on occasion and tried to save some money on a 16GB card. It appears he was right and I was wrong. I've bought a lot of Kingston memory over the years and feel comfortable with that brand. The SD Adapter is a nice touch, although, as it turns out, the card reader I bought from Amazon a few months earlier can read microSD cards directly. All and all, I'll use the card for audio and look forward to the price of higher speed high capacity cards coming down in price in coming months. I recommend the card as a value priced storage option that is fine for audio, but not at least for some video."}

Not that it matters (in my opinion) for this phone, but the class 4 card was cheaper (strange?!?!?). 2. Packaging? Yes, it arrived in the Kingston packaging with the card reader. It arrived in the brown box with air cushions along with a couple of other small items I ordered. 3. Operation- did the item work? Nope. After shutting down my phone and removing the old card. I inserted the new card in and rebooted. The phone did not recognize it at all. Insert the old card, and the old one responds. Re-insert the new one, and it doesn't work. Tried to format it, and it wont recognize it. Took the card and the card reader and placed it in my PC...my PC says there is an error on the card...should the PC fix it? I said 'yes' and tried to correct the errors using Win 7 Ult 64-bit, but the PC gave me a message that the card is corrupt. Sent it back.... 4. Would I recommend this product? Unfortunately with all my effort and still not being able to fix this card, I would not recommend this card..."}

For myself, I needed extra storage for an android tablet that I had purchased. The class 4 speed rating is fine for this use. I have loaded it up with ebooks, music, videos, and about 4 full-length movies. No problems. Don't let the speed rating turn you away if you need it for similar use. I would only use a higher speed card if I needed one for a camera or videorecorder. For storage and playback, the speed class 4 works fine saves a good bit of money."}

I was able to efficiently transfer files, pictures and music to and from my phone. The product itself is a breeze to use, you simply fit the microSD into the SD adapter and you've got yourself an imitation SD card. Please note (though it may be a little obvious) the SD retains no memory, it is just an adapter."}

I have a microSDHC-to-USB adaptor that is flaky (my Macbook keeps saying I ejected it improperly while it is still in the machine) so I was happy to have the microSDHC-to-SDHC adaptor. That works perfectly on my Macbook Air--no overheating, no false ejections. Yes, this adaptor is flimsy (plastic with metal connectors) but I use it only for file transfers for my Sansa Fuze. If you are using this in an SD device...why? Just get an SD card. The adaptor is certainly strong enough for occasional file transfers. Just do not manhandle it. No more SanDisk memory for me, but I am still happy they make the Sansa Fuze. By the bye, Kingston is Taiwan manufacture (China assembly)."}

However, when I checked the shipping details it turns out that Global means U.S.A. WTF??? last time I checked global meant global, i.e. all countries on Earth (except those that the good old U.S. of A doesn't like, i.e. Cuba, North Korea etc). I didn't realise that global didn't include Australia, a country with which the U.S. agreed a free trade agreement over 10 years ago.

I made sure the microSDHC Class 4 works on the phone before purchasing it and it does work (I can save music, files, and photos easily on my computer). The only problem is that when I put it in the phone slot, the phone automatically formats the card and you don't get anything close to 7GB (AND IT DELETED ALL THE DATA when it formatted). The memory says there's only about 3.4GB free so it would be a waste of money for that much space. I thought about changing the FAT32 to a different format on the computer but it was wasteless effort. Right now, I'm using the Kingston 4GB microSDHC with no problems on the SGH t819 (I also saved about $10). By the way, the card isn't great with the Samsung Gravity either if anyone's interested to know..."}

{"Verified Purchase":true,"Star Rating":5,"Username":"Actuarial Ken","Profile":"/gp/pdp/profile/AZHLZKZNFO7NZ","Helpful Votes":"1.0/2.0","Review":"I bought this card for my Samsung Captivate and it was really fast for reading files from my phone. Although this is not the fastest micro sd you can get, but as far as using it on a phone, I have no complaints and whatsoever as I rarely use my phone to do any other stuff that is related to using the micro sd except for listening music and saving camera pics. If you are a real heavy phone user (execute a lot of apps from your card), I would recommend getting at least a class 6 card (phone support class 6), otherwise, this is the card for you as you will get the most out of your money for this cheap high capacity card. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"}

Then it died and took some of my vacation photos with it. UPDATE: Kingston contacted me the day after I posted this review and reminded me that all Kingston memory cards are lifetime guaranteed. So they are replacing it. That makes me happy. They also explained to me that Android and some of the previous memory cards did not get along, shortening the life of the cards, but this has supposedly been resolved. Let's hope so."}

For the price Amazon sells it for, compared to the big box stores, it's almost a steal! But that's not what the review is about. It's about the product, not the other unrelated attributes. As a Class 4 card, it's not as fast as the newer Class 6 or Class 10. But for photo taking or lower resolution video capture (both of which are probably the main reasons for this card, due to its small form factor), it'll be just fast enough. The added SD adapter to fit the MicroSD card into is a great touch - another nice addition compared to what you'd buy it for in the big box stores. Unfortuantely, it is missing one of the nice plastic SD card holders that many SD cards come with. But if you've bought a number of SD cards for various other devices, you may already have some of them out there you can use in its place. I did have to knock off a star for that though. All in all though, a great buy!"}

James \"Starman\"","Profile":"/gp/pdp/profile/A33L4T3PQT9XUO","Helpful Votes":"1.0/2.0","Review":"Amazon listing has this card as a retail packed item, but if you buy it from any of the marketplace sellers, like I did (to save on P&P), there's every chance you'll end up with a loose card & adapter, in the little transparent plastic holder/box. The authenticity of such cards is anybody's guess. My previous similarly bulk packed Samsung 8GB, class 6 micro card is a typical example - card died after roughly a year of sparing use. It now no longer writes data but I can read the stuff that's already on it. So my advice to anyone on the lookout for one of these cards - pay the xtra few bucks & get the retail pack which will last you a good long while, not to mention the peace of mind that comes with getting the real deal for your money. I've now bit the bullet & bought the retail pack with the USB adapter, directly from Amazon (if you're like me & hate to pay P&P, the obvious tip: buy it with another Amazon item to make up the $25 & avoid the shipping charges on both - which is what I ended up doing)."}

Then I burned a honeycomb android boot disc for my nook on a san disc 4gig class 4 card. worked great fast and prefect. So I decided to put it on the kingston 16g class 4...horribly slow so slow it crashes every application you try to open. I have reloaded it and reformatted it still fails to give me the speed advertised but the space is there. Guess it's going in the trash at this point. I then burned the same image on a PNY 4g class 4 card and it works great also...The problem is I didn't read these reviews first...I looked at the price and the 4 stars on the order page. Not sure how it managed that many good ratings unless it was just a huge lot of bad disc. I will never by kingston again....it get 1 star because it is 16 gig."}

Suffice it to say, buyers should beware, there many Kingston fakes out there. I'd be happy to hear that you can get a genuine 32gb Kingston MicroSDHC for under $30, as I've heard that it is an excellent product, but I am not willing to shell out $30 only to discover a fake. Shame on those who sell fake products and I hope Amazon and Kingston find some ways to curtail or discourage such activity as it also needlessly hurts their reputations. Lame."}

You can put lots of music on this; enough that you do not need to leave home. It will play all kinds of music. But sometimes the bass is \"woooow\" like a stomp is going on in the house. It can get pretty scary if there be a storm going while you have headphones on and all of a sudden - bang!!! and lights flash!!! and it was so loud in the headphones you cant know that it was even out there what if someone was trying to sneak up on you??? you wouldn't know until it was to late that is why they tell you that listening to music to loud can hurt you-watch out for this and this will be a purchase that is pleasing to you"}

Although it has the storage capacity, for some odd reason my apps will not save to the card. Unfortunately, this prevents me from knowing how well the card truly works or if its defective. I purchased it long ago and have just lived with it :/ It was still a bargain compared to buying it in the store, but maybe I got what I paid for."}

I am however, concerned with the weight of the plastic on the adapter card, are these really made by Kingston? - they just seem way too thin and flimsy. That said, it does take a while for a pc or Mac to recognize the card - and when it does the icon flashes on the GUI for a few seconds(flickers). Doesn't exactly seem right, but it's working today. I hope it works tomorrow."}

I had an 8GB card in it that was filling up. So I bought this to replace it. Worked like a champ. One potential negative is that I find that my Fuze's battery is draining ever so slightly faster than it was with the 8GB. It's such a small difference that I'm not even sure it is actually occurring but it seems that way to me. It really is very little difference though."}

The manufacture responded saying the IPOD was not repairable as the chip, which the manufacture said should of worked, had fried the IPOD beyond repair. My grandson is 17, very knowledgeable about electronics. The manufacture of the IPOD confirmed he purchased the correct product. My grandson is now saving money to get a new IPOD.

I have never seen the post office deliver something so fast. Unlike most reviewers, mine came in original packaging and unopened. No formatting required. At first it didn't work on a PC I use just to store files on. It did however work on my main PC. Downloading was effortless. Some noticed slower than expected speeds but I thought mine was very acceptable. Now the not so good: Only 14G.....not the advertised 16G. Not the end of the world but that's a lot of info not being able to transfer. Disappointed, yes but when reading the other reviews I guess I got lucky, very lucky. All in all I'm happy but considering I have to give up 2G just to get a quality product when so many got zilch is ridiculous. I will not buy a Kingston product again because of this. Two stars for the omission of memory and not as advertised expectations. Four stars for the insanely fast shipping."}

I wanted something affordable and was willing to wait the extra time I thought it would take to receive the memory cards from an online dealer. The fact is I received the cards before I received my new phone and even improved the memory on the temporary phone solution I purchased for emergency call. These cards are reasonable enough I ordered an additional 2 so I can rotate my selections and media stored on my MP3 player and phones. They ROCK- Hardcore! Anybody I hear of needing a solution - quick or otherwise I am recommending these cards from this seller. Yes I could have gone with larger memory but who really uses more than 8 gigs at a time? And that coming from a part time web designer, game writer and EHR specialist!"}

Both the card and the converter work perfectly. Bear in mind when you purchase flash memory cards that \"4GB\" is, of course, 'technical' gigabytes, as opposed to 'real' gigabytes, so when you format the card, you will end up with less space than 4GB available on it."}

Turns out this is a regular occurance with this item and there really is not much to be done about it.

It just took me 10 minutes to transfer a 55.0 mb file to this card. This came shipped in what appeared to be authentic packaging (wish I'd snapped a photo but didn't) but who is to say that this isn't actually a fake. After 2 months with this, I'm ready to return it for a replacement but am not sure if Amazon will let me. Buyer beware."}

{"Verified Purchase":true,"Star Rating":3,"Username":"John Doe","Profile":"/gp/pdp/profile/A18ACWANS91R12","Helpful Votes":"1.0/3.0","Review":"The Micro 8GB Micro SDHC card works great. I put it into my phone (windows mobile 6) and that was that. It was recognized with about 7.4GB. I wanted to format the card before putting all of the intended information and data on the card. Unfortunately I could not do this because my SD Adapter did not work. This may not be a problem with the adapter itself rather possibly a windows/dell problem. I put the 8GB SDHC card into the SD adapter and tried it on 5 different computers (each of them were Dells and running windows xp/vista, and had a card reader). I put the adapter w/ SDHC card into each card readers and as I tried to access it through \"My Computer\" the computer would just freeze until I took the Adapter w/ SDHC card out. It DID however work when someone from my school campus put the SD Adapter w/ SDHC card into a USB SD card adapter and plugged that into the computer. Unfortunately I didn't have the permission (administrator) to format the card at school leaving all of my previous efforts futile! Im giving this product 3 stars only because of the adapter. The 8GB SDHC card is just fine, works beautifully. But if the adapter won't work with windows xp/vista I am going to guess that it will be completely useless for the majority of people."}

In the past, I have had nothing but problems with Chinese made SD cards losing data or renaming the files on thier own to something not recognizable by the computer, and non-erasable.

I am using them with DVR's I could not understand why I kept getting jumpy jittery video on a card of this speed so finally I tested the data rate transfer speeds with three of the best programs out there. To may surprise I could not get data transfer speeds any faster that 2.50 ms and also got several measurements as low as 2.1ms after 30 separate tests. When averaged out the speed is not even close to class four. So once again I have gotten bogus merchandise form amazon and as a seller myself have resold to my customer this crap. My time in valuable and I value my customers even if amazon does not seem to value their customers. I will write amazon once again and tell them I have received another product other than the one advertised. Oh buy the way I bought another class 4 card and a class 6 msd card from another vendor and did not have the same issue with video recording. Thanks Amazon Update I sent this review to customer service and got a response from Hari. D. asking me what I had done to make sure the products were defective. How obvious does one have to be to see that Hara D. Best wishes did not even read the email or the review. It's nice to know that ones emails ends up in some far away country where they think all Americans are stupid and where their management feels that if they save Amazon a buck someday they can come to America and be a true capitalist. I hope Hari D get promoted for keeping his or her numbers up. Thanks Amazon for not taking care of this issue. I asked Hari D to pass my new three paragraph email on to someone who really cares. I stopped using Amazon awhile back because I kept getting merchandise that was not what it was advertise to be. I thought I'd try them again and see if anything had changed. Now I get to waist more of my valuable time in some far away chat response room where the email will most likely just die. USA used to stand for something other than Stupid uneducated Americans. As several have stated here about this item, most people have no clue what they are buying. All one has to do is look on the net as there are thousands of merchant wanting the business. Amazon would do well to remember this because new companies are born out of need everyday. Maybe Hari brother was the lucky one who got my job at United Technologies Mosktec.... Best To you all THIS IS AN UPDATE...... Amazon has chosen to make this purchase right and deal with the issues via the feedback I left. I hope they follow through and do as they have committed. Please test your purchases form any manufacturer as most of these devices are now made in china and get mislabeled or are not made to specs and sold as better made storage devices than they are. Vendors don't always know this unless they are informed. There are many easy ways to test, get what you pay for because the next application you use these items for may not work as well because they will only work well with specified speeds and storage....

But when the shipping cost is greater than the product you are not getting a deal. Amazon has a way a making you think that you are there prices are cheaper, but when you have to pay shipping cost on each item ( even from the same vendor) there is no savings."}

Told it was lost in the mail, and when I asked for it to be reshipped, they would not send it to the same address and refunded the order against my express wishes. Avoid eTech purchases."}

Once you switch to a new music program it works well. The card then got caught in my card reader slot in my computer, meaning that it jammed that even though it was originally in the adapter (I must not have put it in far enough, and so i guess it just came out). I then broke it in the process of it getting unjammed. This doesnt really matter interms of the card itself though hence why its still 4 stars."}

So now I have over 8 gigs of unneeded space on my camera. Just make sure to check the device you want to use it in is able to hold HC cards. It sucked for me, but still a viable product."}

Overall it is very nice but one small error kind of ruins the whole aura of professionalism Amazon is trying to portray here. In the optional 'rate an individual attribute' section of this page is a terrible example of poor English, poor proofreading habits, and overall laziness. This kind of sloppiness is unforgiveable: Optional: Rate this item's attributes Suggest new attributes for this item Be the first to suggest attributes for this item (Optional) Does what it says Delivery time Take a lot of time to dellivery Did somebody from China write that last one or what? Hang your heads in shame Amazon... and hire a proofreader."}

I had converted a movie and it worked fine on another micro card, took it off to put it (with others) on this large 8gb card and would freeze the player (only thing on the card). Aparently formatting the card does not work either. Returning the card today. My Sandisk Fuze MP3 player does work with other brands of micro sdhc cards but not Kingston. Will not buy another one again."}

I though I would spend a few more dollars for a larger card - wrong. My device only works with microSD - 2 GB is the largest size for microSD. MicroSDHC is a completely different technology/format. My computer also will not recognize the microSDHC format. Be sure which format you need."}

My sole purpose was to have a Mico Flash Card that could be used in a standard SD slot on my computor. I quickly found out that it does not work with Windows XP (which I have), it only works with Windows Vista. You can only use a 2GB or smaller SD card with Windows XP. Wish I had know this on the front end."}
