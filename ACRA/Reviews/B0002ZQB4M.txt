Ordinary pens, as most men (& some women, no doubt) realize, act like thermometers when carried in one's pocket. Body temperature causes the ink in the cartridge to expand, leading to leaks, ruptures & other non-performance. Pencils break. The pen is considerably smaller & thinner than I expected. It also sports my least favorite implement: the medium ballpoint. I also fretted over the detached cap. One more thing to loose. After a couple of months, however, I'm completely sold. It's thinness permits it to fit snugly into the rings of the small binder notebooks I use, greatly reducing the tendency to get lost or become a headache to find while covering a speech or interviewing. The ink flows perfectly, never pools or threatens to leak. Although I have large hands I find it very easy to write with (size of the pads I carry in pocket is much more of an issue that cramps my writing). People are idiosyncratic & highly individual in what we prefer to write with--I've always been a pencil guy--but the Fisher, appearing to embody everything I don't like in a pen, has completely won me over. I have to stop myself from pulling it out of my pocket to write with at home--but it's ink supply probably isn't infinite, & they are a bit costly to replace. So, only on the job."}

Not once did it fail to create a smooth, legible, and clean line when writing with it. I highly recommend this pen to you if any of the following are true: 1. You communicate through writing that is not cuneiform stamped into clay tablets. 2. You are not alergic to metal. 3. You are currently in space. 4. You do not want to wear a pocket protector. 5.

It's 3 3/4\" collapsed, 5 1/4\" provoked, and feels like any normal ballpoint despite its small collapsed size. The ink flows smoothly and the writing experience is somewhere between that of a cheap ballpoint and luxurious fountain pen. The top is held on by a rubberized gasket and the pen has the heft of an empty rifle cartridge. I wear it in pocketed button-down shirts and love its unobtrusiveness. It's also tough enough to be clipped in your back pocket and sat on. It can also be clipped onto a T-shirt or into athletic shorts. Unlike other users I have not had trouble with the clip coming loose, but imagine that could be remedied with super glue if necessary. Life is just a little easier when you've always got a good pen."}

I've tried extremely small pens in my wallet before, but they often wouldn't work when I took them out. I don't have a super small wallet to begin with (I have a small change pocket in it where I end up keeping it), so I'm not bothered by a little more thickness. If you are, then this may not work as a wallet pen for you. For me though it's relatively unnoticeable, it always works and is a pretty comfortable size to use. As others have mentioned, the clip kinda sucks and I just took it off so it's just smooth. I haven't tried a lot of other space pens, so it's possible that there's something out there slightly slimmer that works just as well, but for now this is a great way to always have a pen that works available."}

It seems to me that the best pen is the pen that you will carry with you and have to use when needed. This one is small enough to keep in your pants pocket or clip in a shirt pocket and always have a pen with you. Put the cap on the back end of the pen when using and it extends it long enough for use with large hands. Haven't had much opportunity to use it upside down or underwater as advertised, but it does write on just about every surface. Some models sold do not have the pocket clip but worth making sure you get one that does. Can easily be removed if you find you don't want it but it makes it really convenient to have."}

(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on). On the other hand, if you never ever want to remove the clip, you could take the gamble that yours will be adhered like mine was, and if it doesn't bend out like it did on someone else here, it might be fine for your needs."}

The pen itself is great, it feels solid when closed and disappears into my pocket. I'm a minimalist and avoid pocket bulge but this pen doesn't bother me at all. When you open the pen for writing and put the cap on the back end it nearly doubles in size and is a very comfortable tool to write with. The black ink isn't the darkest but it's on par with Bic and the other dime-a-dozen cheap plastic pens. Only a felt tip pen will come out darker, but this is ballpoint so it's not a fair comparison. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a small pen they can forget about in a pocket and pull out when needed."}

It is so small when closed I don't even notice it in my front pocket! That being said though... at first I was keeping this in my front pocket with the clip. Bad decision as I often ride a bicycle for commuting and I actually lost it somewhere and was not able to find it! I ordered a second one because I loved the pen so much! I did order this exact same model (with the clip) because even though I don't use the clip in my pants pocket anymore (I think they/Fisher should make the clip with some kind of hook design on the end so that it makes sure that you mean to detach it from something rather than just sliding it off) I still don't feel it at all down in my pocket! It just disappears (mostly disappears - if it ends up sitting sideways in your pocket, depending on the pocket style on the pants, it might be felt some when you go to sit down - otherwise I don't really even feel it at all and sometimes I have to check to make sure it's still there.) If you want a reliable pen that is small when closed, regular sized when open, writes smooth and consistently with no skips, is precisely machined, has good looks and comes with a clip (I recommend using the clip on jacket arm pockets as seen on flight suits, pilot jackets, or pockets in shirts/dress shirts - Not clipped to pant pockets) then I recommend getting one of these pens.

It was completely useless right out of the box. Doesn't write unless you point it perfectly vertical, and then then it won't write very dark. I will be returning and getting a replacement. I'm hoping mine was just defective. EDIT!!!! Amazon made an exchange a breeze, my previous pen must have been defective because the replacement is lovely. The matte black finish has a sort of brushed metal texture and looks fantastic. I also thought the clip was silver from the picture but it is also black. The pen writes perfectly and smooth, and the best part about this pen is that when closed it is very small and perfect for every day carry in a pocket, but when opened and the cap put on the back, it is a full size pen and feels great in the hand."}

Love the pen, and the technology. Writes easily, smoothly, permanently on many surfaces and for occasional, field use in ballistics data notebooks (DOPE) there's nothing better and I've never had one dry out in all the years (decades?) I've been using them. Pricey, but they just keep on working. Reliability costs a little extra these days, and this is worth the price of admission.

I really like the compact size, but also the ability to uncap the pen and put the cap on the opposite end, extending the length of the pen to make it comfortable in the hand while signing a document. It is worth paying a little extra to have the clip included. The clip keeps the pen attached to the phone case on my belt until the pen is needed.

But, being a kid, I lost it. I don't know why it took me so long to buy another bullet. This thing is amazing! Likes: - The matte finish looks and feels great. - The size is great for throwing in your front pocket. I put in in my jeans pocket and forget it's there. The size is also nice for clipping it in your polo. It does not protrude out of my shirt like full size pens do. - The clip hasn't budged yet. I knew going into it that people had issues with the clip. Mine has not moved. But if it did come off I would probably score the area where I want the clip to go and would use some JB weld or something. - The pen locks securely into place when in the closed or open position. - The ink is great. Smooth and consistent. I've used space pen refills in other pens: Parker Jotter, Zebra F701, and Schrade 2nd gen tac pen. But using a fisher refill WITH a fisher pen is by far the best. Thanks to this pen, I might pick up a cap-o-matic in the near future."}

I love the compact size -- it fits on a rhodia pad in my back pocket & it writes reliably. The replacement cartridges are readily available and reasonable priced and come in a variety of colors/sizes. I've seen better/blacker ink and pens that are a lot more precise. But I consider this one of my essential everyday items. That being said, many reviews have noted that the clip is sometimes either too tight or too loose (so it is either difficult to get off the pen or it always wants to slide off). I have found these issues tolerable. What I found less pleasing is that the clip of my latest pen snapped at the bend within a couple weeks of owning it. Other reviews noted this as well, but my past pens were fine. Fisher said they would replace the pen...if I shipped the entire pen back to them at my expense. Since this would have left me without a pen and would have cost more than a new clip, I've opted to handle a replacement through amazon."}

No skipping, doesn't quit when you write on the wall calendar, and for me, it has a nice feel laying down ink (for reference, I'm a Pelikan fountain pen fan). The clip keeps the thing from rolling around. One complaint with the Space Pen cartridges is that at some point, they get 'blobby'. Let me help you with that - you open the pen and the first letter gets a nice fat blob of ink. Eeeew. Google is awesome, and somewhere some genius discovered that making a small 1.5mm ball of tissue (kleenex) and putting it in the cap cures the blob problem. It sounds temporary I know, but the same tissue ball has been my pen for over a year and it has complete cured the one bad habit that this pen ever had. Excellent EDC pen."}

After reading all the poaitive reviews spread throughout the web, the plan was to carry the Bullet, and use the AG-7 at the office. They were both delivered within the 2 days for prime members and I immediately inpsected these marvels. First reactions. AG-7, felt really loose at the clicker. I thought that if I shook the pen hard enough, it would engage the clicker and the point would be exposed. Once engaged, the medium point is huge. I feel like I'm writing with a marker. The fine point tips are ordered and on the way! After disassembling the pen numerous times, trying to think of a way to make the pen more \"solid\", I simply tried a few different springs from a few different clickers and found a good match to the barrel of the Fisher. You can't pull the factory spring out (which bothers me), but you can semmingly put another spring in the barrel without damaging the internals. Problem solved. The clicker now has some substantial beef behind it and there is no play in the pen. I feel like I effectively doubled the amount of pressure it takes to click the pen. The pen now feels 100% solid in my hand. Bullet: Awesome...I have large hands and after moving the cap to the rear of the pen, it is an excellent writing instrument. Can't wait to get the fine point cartridges for the Bullet and AG-7. I bought the matte black version and I'm very pleased. Feels solid, collapses to a great pocket size, and writes wonderfully. Can't ask for much more. Although, I did buy the version with the clip already \"installed\". It fell off the first time I tried to clip it to something. Tried to put it back on the pen, but ended up scratching the pen and didn't feel like it was secure, so I took it off. Save your money, get the bullet without the clip. I'm glad to have both, but if I had to pick one, I'd probably pick the bullet over the AG-7. Price, versatility, and the ability to throw it in a pair of jeans and not worry about ink stains or stabbing my leg all point towards the Bullet."}

As a writing insterment it works well for what is is designed for, something small to keep in your pants pocket. But the design makes it easy to slip out of your pocket when seated. I have found that the ones with the clip and matte finish seem not to be as slick as the chrome ones and I tend to keep them longer. The matte finish does wear to a nice brassing like a old SLR camera, which I like. I keep waiting for my last pen to turn up since I find [...] shipping for something I loose every 6 months a little steep."}

P. \"F\"","Profile":"/gp/pdp/profile/AGYL651SRILRQ","Helpful Votes":"4.0/9.0","Review":"Like many people I take notes, make list and doodle and write my thoughts down during all hours of the day and I get tired of using pens that will not dispense ink right away or have too fine a point. After some though I decided to invest (because that is what it is when you write as much as 5-7 hours a day) in a pen that would fit all my needs, which are a follows: 1) Dispense ink from the get go 2) Be neither too fine a point or to broad 3) Be durable and reliable 4) Compact or slim so as to keep a slim profile in my pocket. 5) Nothing extravagant or flashy, just something simple. So I started my search first at a few local shops but all they had were fountain pens that were way to flashy for my needs, I'm not trying to impress anyone with this pen. SO then I went to amazon.com and started a search and was rewarded with a quick find of the Black Matte Bullet Space Pen. I read a few reviews and thought this was the pen for me and it was for a while. It met all my needs except for number three. While it could recover from a fall and get stepped on without losing its finish it would sometimes get stuck and couldn't be opened until pried apart with the use of pliers. This happened three times since I first got the pen in mid December till now, late February. I have no idea why it would do this, I'm not slamming the pen down to close it and I'm not man handling it either so it seems that is periodically will just tighten up on it's own for no reason. Other than this I found the pen had a great writing point and I never found my self scribbling on a spare piece of paper or licking the tip to get the ink to dispense. I loved the fact this it was small and I didn't find it cumbersome in my pockets or when attaching it to my journals or notebooks. I only recommend this pen if you can figure out the closing quick. I you don't want to waster your time figuring it out I would suggest to start searching for a better pen than this, I'm still looking for one myself"}
